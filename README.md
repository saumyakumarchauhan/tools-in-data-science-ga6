# 📘 Tools in Data Science GA-6 Repository

This repository contains solution guides and resources for **Graded Assignment 6 (GA-6)** of the *Tools in Data Science* course offered by **IIT Madras** as part of the **B.S. in Data Science** program.

The goal of this repository is to help fellow students understand the concepts, tools, and methods used in each question through structured README files and step-by-step implementations.

---

## 📂 Structure

Each question is organized into a separate folder:

- `q-1` to `q-16` → Contains the specific files, code, data references, or README documentation for each graded question.

---

## ✅ What’s Included

- 📊 **Excel-based** forecasting, outlier detection, and regression analyses
- 📈 **Python-based** data analysis, network graph algorithms, JSON handling
- 🗂 **DuckDB SQL** solutions for correlation and data filtering
- 🧠 **Explanatory README.md** files for each task with generalized instructions so all students (even with different datasets) can apply the approach
- 💡 **Tips, formulas, and example outputs** included where helpful

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Promote collaborative learning
- Provide clear guidance without giving direct answers
- Help students replicate methods with their own unique datasets

> ❗ All solutions are written to be adaptable and should **not** be copy-pasted without understanding.
